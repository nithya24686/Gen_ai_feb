# Generative AI Professional Program

## Program Overview

**Course Description:**
This course provides an in-depth journey into Generative AI, covering the theoretical foundations, tools, and practical skills required to design and deploy AI models that generate text, images, audio, and more. Students will explore deep learning architectures, fine-tune large language models (LLMs), and build applications powered by generative AI.

By the end of the course, learners will be equipped to work on cutting-edge projects in AI, including chatbots, content generation, image synthesis, and AI-driven creative applications.
